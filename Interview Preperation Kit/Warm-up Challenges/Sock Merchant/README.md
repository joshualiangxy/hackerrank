My initial thoughts for this problem was that I could do something similar to the problem where we check for matching brackets using the Stack ADT.

So, for this problem, I decided to create a list of integers storing the socks.

For each colour we encounter in the original array, we add the sock to the list if it is not already in the list.

If the sock is already in the list, we take the sock out and increment a counter.

Looking at this question, I immediately thought of using a symbol table so that I could get `O(1)` search on the set of inputs I have been given.

Preprocessing the input strings took `O(n)` time, where `n` is the number of input strings.

Next, creating the result array and processing the queries takes `O(k)` time, where `k` is the number of queries.

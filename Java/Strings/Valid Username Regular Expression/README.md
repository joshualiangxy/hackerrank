We use the regex `"^[A-Za-z]\\w{7,29}$"`.

The `'^'` and `'$'` characters indicate the start and end of the regex, which is necessary since we are using the `matches()` method, so it will return `true` if the string contains the regex anywhere within it if we do not include the `'^'` and `'$'`.

`"\\w{7,29}"` indicates that there are 7 to 29 alphanumeric characters or underscores.
